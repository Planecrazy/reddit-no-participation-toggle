# Reddit No Participation Toggle

[Reddit No Participation Toggle](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reddit-no-participation-t/kbggmcnpaopajfmhojfogfcbgdmnbann) is a Google Chrome extension that allows you to disable the new "No Participation" feature many subreddits have recently implemented.

This extension adds a "[NP on/off]" link to all reddit pages (in the upper-
right, next to the "preferences" link to allow you to quickly toggle NP). When NP
is disabled, this extension replaces every np.reddit.com and www.np.reddit.com link
with its corresponding non-NP link. Note that this does not disable NP functionality, but
instead attempts to make it so they are never encountered to begin with. As such,
if you go directly to a NP link, you will still not be able to vote or comment (although
this extension has the added benefit of turning all of the links on an NP page back into non-NP links).

Reddit No Participation Toggle generally plays well with the Reddit Enhancement Suite 
(RES) everywhere RES normally works (as far as I know).
